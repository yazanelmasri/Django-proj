The Apex management system was created to organize employee data and key functions within their HR department, including recruitment & onboarding, time and attendance tracking, performance management, training & development, payroll, and benefits administration.

## Agile:
This project was created using Agile principles via a projectboard on Github. This is the first time I have implemented Agile as an individual developer. However, creating user stories and identifying accepterance criteria acted as a roadmap to target the various features and functionalities of the application. It helped me stay on track and reduced distractions.
